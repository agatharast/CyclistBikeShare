----- Step 1 : Combine all data into a table -----

CREATE TABLE CyclistBike.CyclistData AS
(SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.Cyclist01`
UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.Cyclist02`
UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.Cyclist03`
UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.Cyclist04`
UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.Cyclist5`);

SELECT count(1)
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`;


-----Step 2 : Check the data for anomalies-----

SELECT DISTINCT member_casual AS Member_Type
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`;

SELECT min(start_lng) AS Min_Start_Length,
  max(start_lng) AS Max_Start_Length,
  min(end_lng) AS Min_End_Length,
  max(end_lng) AS Max_End_Length,
  min(start_lat) AS Min_Start_Lat,
  max(start_lat) AS Max_Start_Lat,
  min(end_lat) AS Min_End_Lat,
  max(end_lat) AS Max_End_Lat
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`;

SELECT end_station_id, end_station_name, count(1) AS count
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE end_station_id IS NOT NULL AND end_station_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY end_station_id, end_station_name;

SELECT rideable_type, count(1) AS count
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
GROUP BY rideable_type;

---Check if the data contains NULL---

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE started_at IS NULL AND ended_at IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE started_at IS NULL OR ended_at IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE start_lat IS NULL AND end_lat IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE start_lng IS NULL AND end_lng IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE member_casual IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE rideable_type IS NULL;

--Make sure that all data we use not contains NULL--


-----Step 3: Clean the data-----

--Filter data: not contains NULL and started time less than ended time--
SELECT *
FROM `CyclistBike.CyclistData`
WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL AND start_station_id IS NOT NULL AND end_station_name is NOT NULL AND end_station_id IS NOT NULL AND start_lng IS NOT NULL AND start_lat IS NOT NULL AND end_lng IS NOT NULL AND end_lat IS NOT NULL AND started_at <= ended_at AND rideable_type IS NOT NULL;

--Download the data and use in Tableau--
