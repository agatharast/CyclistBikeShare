# CyclistBikeShare
A case study from Google Data Analytics on Coursera

In this case study, we follow the steps bellow:

1. ASK
To analyse how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members

2. PREPARE
The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website: https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data
For my analysis, I use data from 2021 (because I use Google Cloud that have a limited access to upload a large data, so I only use data from January to May 2021)

3. PROCESS
I use SQL to process the data, since I'm newbie so I use a simple syntax to clean and process the data. You can check the SQL file on here:

4. ANALYZE
Queries I use to analyze data in SQL you can see on the same link like bellow.

5. SHARE
Visualization I made using Tableau Public. You can check the published here:

6. ACT
A powerpoint presentation can be downloaded using Tableau by choosing the 4 last sheet on my Tableau.
